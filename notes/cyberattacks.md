## 🛡️ Common Types of Cyber Attacks 

---

• `Social Engineering` – Tricking or manipulating people into giving away private information or performing actions that help attackers.  
Attackers don’t hack computers — they hack **people’s trust**.

##### ✏️ Example:
**ILOVEYOU Virus (2000)** — This virus spread through emails titled **"I LOVE YOU"**. When users opened the attachment (thinking it was a love letter), the script ran and overwrote files, spread to everyone in their contact list, and caused billions of dollars in damage.

---

• `Phishing` – Fake emails, messages, or websites made to look legitimate in order to **steal passwords, credit card numbers, or personal info**.  
Attackers often pretend to be trusted companies or people.

##### ✏️ Example:
**Twitter Hack (2020)** — Hackers used phishing to trick Twitter employees into giving up login credentials to internal tools. They used those tools to take over accounts like **Elon Musk**, **Barack Obama**, and others to promote a Bitcoin scam.

---

• `Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans)` – Software made to **damage, spy on, or steal information** from computers.  
- **Viruses** attach to files and spread when those files are shared.  
- **Worms** spread automatically through networks.  
- **Trojans** disguise themselves as harmless programs.

##### ✏️ Example:
**WannaCry Ransomware (2017)** — A global cyberattack that used a leaked NSA hacking tool called **EternalBlue** to exploit a Windows vulnerability and **spread automatically like a worm**.  
Once infected, computers had their files encrypted and saw a message demanding payment in Bitcoin to restore access.  
Hospitals, banks, and companies across **150+ countries** were affected, including the UK’s National Health Service, which had to cancel thousands of medical appointments.


---

• `Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)` – Overwhelms a website or server with so much traffic that it **crashes or becomes unavailable**.  
A DDoS attack (Distributed DoS) uses **many hacked computers or IoT devices** at once.

##### ✏️ Example:
**Dyn DNS Attack (2016)** — A massive DDoS attack targeted Dyn, a company that manages domain names (like the internet’s address book).  
Hackers used a botnet made of **hacked IoT devices**—such as webcams, DVRs, and routers—to flood Dyn’s servers with requests.  
As a result, major websites like **Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, and Reddit** were offline for hours across large parts of the U.S. and Europe.

---

• `SQL Injection` – Inserting **malicious database commands** into a website’s form or URL to view, modify, or delete data.  
Happens when a website doesn’t properly filter user input before sending it to a database.

##### ✏️ Example:
**Sony Pictures Breach (2011)** — Attackers exploited vulnerable website forms using SQL injection to access Sony’s user database.  
They stole personal data from over **77 million PlayStation Network accounts**, including usernames, passwords, and emails.  
The breach forced Sony to take its entire network offline for weeks and caused major financial losses and damage to its reputation.

---

• `Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)` – An attacker secretly **intercepts communication** between two people or systems.  
They can read or modify messages without either side knowing.

##### ✏️ Example:
**Superfish Adware (2015)** — Lenovo pre-installed a program called Superfish on some of its laptops to show users ads.  However, the software installed its own fake security certificate, which allowed attackers to **intercept encrypted HTTPS traffic** and view users’ private data.  This incident showed how even pre-installed software can create serious privacy and security risks.

---

• `Credential Stuffing` – Attackers use **stolen usernames and passwords** from one breach to log in to accounts on other websites (because many people reuse passwords).  

##### ✏️ Example:
**Zoom Credential Leak (2020)** — Hackers took login information from earlier breaches (like LinkedIn and Yahoo) and tried the same credentials on Zoom accounts. Thousands of accounts were accessed, exposing meeting information and emails.  This attack highlighted the importance of using **unique passwords** and **two-factor authentication** for each account.

---

• `Zero-Day Exploits` – Attacks that target **unknown or unpatched software vulnerabilities** — flaws that developers haven’t fixed yet.  
They’re extremely dangerous because no defenses exist yet.

##### ✏️ Example:
**Stuxnet (2010)** — A highly advanced cyberweapon believed to be created by the U.S. and Israel.  
It targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities by infecting Windows systems controlling centrifuges.  
Stuxnet used **four separate zero-day vulnerabilities** to spread undetected and caused physical damage to the centrifuges, setting back Iran’s nuclear program.  
It marked the first known case of malware causing **real-world physical destruction**.

---

• `Ransomware` – Malware that **encrypts files or systems** and demands a ransom (usually in cryptocurrency) to unlock them.  
Victims often face losing critical data if they refuse to pay.

##### ✏️ Example:
**Colonial Pipeline Attack (2021)** — A ransomware group called **DarkSide** breached the network of the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S.  
The hackers used a VPN account (a remote-access login) whose password had been leaked earlier. The account didn’t have multi-factor authentication (MFA), so a single password was enough to get in.
Once inside, the attackers moved through Colonial’s systems to find important machines and tools.
The hackers installed malware that encrypted files, so Colonial couldn’t access billing and operational data.
ecause they couldn’t trust their systems, Colonial stopped pipeline operations to prevent further damage — which caused fuel supply disruptions.
Colonial Pipeline paid a **$4.4 million ransom** in Bitcoin to restore systems, highlighting the growing impact of ransomware on critical infrastructure.
