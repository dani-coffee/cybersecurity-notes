# ðŸ“¡ **Protocols**

â€¢ `SSH` (Secure Shell) - a protocol used for secure communication between devices. It encrypts the entire sessionâ€”including commands and responsesâ€”and decrypts the data once it reaches the destination.
To connect to a Linux machine remotely I can use :
`ssh username@ip_address` ,then I'll ne asked to type the password.
