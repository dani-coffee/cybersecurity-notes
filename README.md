# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Notes 

This repository contains my personal notes and progress as I study and practice cybersecurity.

I’m learning through hands-on platforms like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) with a focus on real-world skills like Linux, networking, web exploitation, and privilege escalation.
