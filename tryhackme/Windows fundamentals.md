• `NTFS (New Technology File System) ` - the main file system that Windows uses to store and manage data on hard drives and SSDs.

| Feature               | What It Means                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **File permissions**  | You can control who can read/edit files (ex:  disc C  ➝ properties ➝ security ➝ group or usernames (and chose an option) ➝ permission for `my choice from previous step` (and chose what I want: full control,modify etc) |
| **Large file support**| Can handle big files (over 4 GB)                  |
| **Reliability**       | Can recover from errors better than older systems |
| **Encryption support**| Supports file encryption (with Pro editions)      |
| **Compression**       | Lets you save space by compressing files          |
| **Alternate Data Streams (ADS)** | Allows hidden data to be attached to files without affecting the main content|

#####  example for ADS: in my already existing txt file I add the code 
      echo This is hidden data > normal.txt:hidden   
      then when I want to read the hidden file I type:    more < normal.txt:hidden    ➝ If I open my notepad I won't see the hidden message
  
•NTFS and older versions :

| File System | Used In           | Max File Size | Notes                                            |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **NTFS**    | Windows (default) | Very large    | Most powerful, supports all features             |
| **FAT32**   | Older systems     | 4 GB max      | Works everywhere but limited                     |
| **HPFS**    | OS/2, early Windows NT | 2 GB–4 GB     | Older file system, replaced by NTFS, not used today      |

• `System32 ` - this folder holds the important files that are critical for the operating system

---

• `UAC` (  User Account Control) - When a task requires administrator-level permission (like installing software or changing system settings), UAC:
1. Pauses the operation
2. Asks for confirmation (or admin credentials if you're on a standard account)
3.  Displays a popup, usually dimming the screen, with options like: "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?"

---

• ` Task Manager` -  a built-in Windows tool that lets you monitor and manage running processes, programs, and system performance.
1. View running apps and background processes
2. End (kill) unresponsive programs
3. Check CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
4. Manage startup programs
5. See user activity
6. Monitor GPU performance

• `BitLocker` is a full‑disk encryption feature built into certain editions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. 
 It is designed to protect data on a drive by encrypting the entire volume so that the data cannot be read without proper authentication or the correct encryption key.
 
---

• `Shadow copies` - point‑in‑time snapshots of a disk volume (or shared folder) that capture the state of files and folders at a specific moment in time. 
They allow me to restore previous versions of files or folders, or recover files that were deleted or overwritten, by going back to an earlier “snapshot” state. 
They aso allow fast recovery from malware/ransomware: If a system is hit with ransomware, having shadow copies can allow you to revert files/folders to pre‑infection states — assuming the snapshots weren’t deleted by the attacker. Many ransomware strains attempt to delete or disable shadow copies before encryption.
