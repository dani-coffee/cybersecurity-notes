# ‚öôÔ∏è **Commands**
‚Ä¢ `ls` -lists all items in the current directory (basic info: file and directory names)
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -ls
        -ls ~/Documents (if there's Documents folder in desktop)

‚Ä¢ `ll` - like ls with the flag -l but shows hidden files too.It lists all items in the current directory but in a long format(more details: file permissions,number of links,owner name, group name,file size,modification date/time,filename)        

‚Ä¢ `cd` - change directory (I have to insert a path(folders!!!))
 ##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
         -cd Desktop (if I'm at my home directory and i do ls, i see Documents,I can do cd Desktop to got to this directory)
         -cd ..    ‚ûù I go back 1 step in my currrent path
         -cd ~    ‚ûù I go back to the home directory no matter where I currently am
         -cd ~/Desktop    ‚ûù if I wanna go back to Desktop directory 

‚Ä¢ `echo` - prints an output to the terminal (adds automatically a newline in the end of a line,unless i add the flag -n)
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -echo Hello world!    ‚ûù prints Hello world!
        -echo file1.txt
        -echo hi! > file1.txt
        -echo hi! >> file1.txt 
        
‚Ä¢ `touch`-creating a new file
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -touch file1.txt
        
‚Ä¢ `cp`-copying content from one file to another
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -cp file1.txt file2.txt

‚Ä¢ `scp`-copying content from one file to another **securely**,using ssh protocol.
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt	‚ûùsee that the destination (ubuntu@192.168.1.30) syntax is exactly the syntax used to connect to a machine remotely using ssh.

‚Ä¢ `rm`  -removing files (and only if i add -R flag, can remove folders too)
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -rm file1.txt file2.txt 
        üî∏note:if I want to remove the directory I have to add the flag -R
        -rm -R directory1
 
‚Ä¢ `whoami` - tells me my username on my machine

‚Ä¢ `mv` - moves a source file or a folder to the destination
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
	-mv file1.txt file2.txt

‚Ä¢ `mkdir` - creates a folder
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -mkdir folder1
        
‚Ä¢ `cat` -prints the contents of the inserted file
#####   ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
            -cat file1.txt
            -cat ~/Desktop/file1.txt    ‚ûù I don't have to use cd to enter to the directory containing the file I want to print,I can just insert the parh adter using                cat

‚Ä¢ `nano` - edit file in terminal (easiest way for now click ctrl+O to save,enter,then ctrl+X to exit)
#####   ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -nano file1.txt
       
‚Ä¢ `pwd` - shows full path to the current directory

‚Ä¢ `df`-shows disk space

‚Ä¢ `find` - instead of continuously using ls and cd, I use this command to find what I need in the current directory and its subdirectories
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -find -name "file2.txt"    ‚ûù finds path of file2.txt,from current directory
        üî∏note: in fact it's equivalent to find . -name "file2.txt" , the dot means the current directory
        -find -name "file1*"    ‚ûù using a wildcard means that any suffix is acceptable-this matches any file that starts with 'file1'

‚Ä¢ `grep` - instead of using cat which prints all of the contents in a file ,I use this command to print the specific data I need and i prints the relevant output lines
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
        -grep "passwords" file1.txt
        -grep -i "word" file1.txt    ‚ûù this one means case insensitive search and will search for WoRd ,WORD etc...
        -grep -c "word" file1.txt     ‚ûù counts how many lines contain the word "word"
        -grep -E "^" file1.txt    ‚ûù equivalent to cat file1.txt,'^'means the start of every line,-E stands for extended regular expression which enables extended regex         syntax.(like OR operator,or grouping expressions)

 ‚Ä¢ `file` - determining the file type

‚Ä¢ `su` - switching user ( for that I must know the username and the password unless I'm logged into my superuser(explanation in Additional notes))
	üî∏note: it's better to use `su -l` ( short for `--login`) because we start a shell that is much more similar to the actual user 		logging into the system

‚Ä¢ `wget` - allows to download files from the web via http
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
        -wget https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/linux-fundamentals/part3/myfile.txt

‚Ä¢ `python3 -m  http.server` - turns my computer into a web server allowing me to download files from the web.If I use this ,I will have to open another terminal to execute my commands or just use operator `&` .To close,'i click `Ctrl+C`
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
	-wget http://10.10.225.38:8000/myfile	‚ûù the structure is: announcing the http protocol,writing he ip_address (full web URL),the port and then the file name I want to pull.
	-wget http://10.10.225.38:8000/myfile &

‚Ä¢ `ps` - viewing processes,shows information such as the pid( process id,its order).

‚Ä¢ `ps aux` - see the processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session (i.e. system processes).

‚Ä¢ `top` - shows real-time statistics about the processes running on my system instead of a one-time view,refreshes every 10s.
	`htop` does the same but the output is colorful
	to stop I do `Ctrl+C`

‚Ä¢ `kill` - kill a process
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
	-kill sigterm 23424	‚ûù kill process+allow to do cleanup tasks
	-kill 4242	‚ûùdefault sigterm flag is used
	-kill sigkill 23424	‚ûù kill process,no cleanup tasks
	--kill sigstop 23424	‚ûùdoesn't kill just suspends/stops a process

‚Ä¢ `systemctl` - this command allows us to interact with the systemd process/daemon. the format of the command is : systemctl [option] [service].
[option] are: start(launch now),stop,enable(start at boot),disable(not to start at boot)
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
	-systemctl start apache2	‚ûùtell apache to start up

‚Ä¢ `fg`  bring a previously backgrounded process back to the foreground





# ‚öôÔ∏è **Flags**

‚Ä¢ `--help` if I write a command accepting flags, and I add '--help' ,it prints all of the possible flags that can go along with this command,is equivalent to 'man' ( man stands for manual),which opens manual version on my machine.
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
        -ls --help
	-grep --help
	-man grep


‚Ä¢ `-h` - human readable format
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
	-ll -h	‚ûù adds the unit in the line containing total
	-df -g	‚ûùadds units to sizes ,making it understandable for us

‚Ä¢ `-a` - short for `--all`,shows all the entries ,the regular once as well as the ones starting with `.`
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples: 
	-ls -a



# ‚öôÔ∏è **Operators**
‚Ä¢`&` - allows to execute background operations while being able to do another operation
##### ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        echo "Start"
        sleep 5 &
        echo "I can type this immediately"


‚Ä¢ `&&` - like in any other programming language ,it means logical and 
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
    -echo Hi && echo There    ‚ûù prints  Hi
                                        There
                                        

‚Ä¢`>` - redirects output to the indicated file
        üî∏note:if the indicated file doesn't exist, a new file with this name is created,otherwise the contents of the indicated fle are overwritten with the current             output.
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
        -echo hi! > file1.txt


‚Ä¢ `>>` - similar to '>' but this one appends,meaning even if the indicated file exists, it just adds the output to the file's original output 




# ‚öôÔ∏è **Common Directories**
‚Ä¢ `/etc` -  stores configuration files that are used by my operating system.It contains for example the `sudoers` file(who can use sudo and what commands they can run),as well as `passwd`(list of users and basic info about them like the username,home folder) and `shadow` files ( stores encrypted password hashes , often in sha512)

‚Ä¢ `/tmp` - similar to how the RAM works. Stores data until the computer is restarted.

‚Ä¢ `/root` -  the home directory of the `root` user, who is the superuser on a Linux system. The root user has full administrative privileges. This directory is different from `/home`, which stores the home directories of regular users.


‚Ä¢ `/var` - a place where the system and programs store changing data like databases,caches,etc.. .Inside it we can find a folder called logs containing the records of what the system and programs have done.




# ‚öôÔ∏è **Keyboard useful combinations**
‚Ä¢ `ctrl + l`    ‚ûù clears terminal
‚Ä¢ `Ctrl + Z`	‚ûùequivalent to adding `&` in the end of a command



# ‚öôÔ∏è **Additional notes**
‚Ä¢using ~ meaning I point to the home directory,so instead of writing home i can write ~
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexamples:
	-cd ~

‚Ä¢When I use `ll` or `ls -l`  the first 10 characters make up the permission string:
`-` indicates a file 
`d` indicates a directory 
`r` `w` `x` -stand for read,write,execute
#####  ‚úèÔ∏èexample:
	 -rwxrwxrwx
`-` indicates that it's a file(not a directory) we work with 
first `rwx` stands for the owner's permissions
second `rwx` stands for the permissions of the group owner of the file
third `rwx` stands for other users permissions

‚Ä¢A superuser (also known as root) is a special user on Linux and Unix systems with full administrative privileges.
